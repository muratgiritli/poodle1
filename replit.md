## User Preferences
I prefer iterative development with clear communication on significant changes. Please ask before making major architectural modifications or adding new external dependencies. For code, I appreciate clean, maintainable TypeScript with a focus on functional components where appropriate. When explaining concepts, use straightforward language, avoiding overly technical jargon.
